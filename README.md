# Baby Textile Shop - E-commerce Web App

This is a small full stack e-commerce project for a textile shop for babies. It uses a Python Flask backend, SQLite database, and a simple HTML/JS/CSS frontend.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` - Flask backend, SQLite DB, and static images
- `frontend/` - HTML, CSS, and JS for the web UI

## How to Run
1. **Backend:**
   - Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
   - Run `python init_db.py` to initialize the database with sample products.
   - Run `pip install flask flask-cors` to install dependencies.
   - Start the backend: `python app.py`
2. **Frontend:**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

## Features
- View baby textile products
- Add products to cart
- Place an order (demo only)

## Notes
- Product images are placeholders. Replace them with real images in `backend/static/`.
- The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.
